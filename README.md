Calculate Your Age! A Fun Front-End Project 🚀
This is my take on a classic project—an age calculator! I built this to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating a fun and highly interactive user experience. It's a simple, yet powerful, tool that showcases how a few lines of code can solve a real-world problem.

Features:

📅 Date Picker: Easily select a date of birth.

🔍 Precise Calculation: Get your age down to the day.

🎨 Custom Styles: The app is designed with a unique color scheme and modern typography to make it stand out.

📱 Mobile-First: Engineered to look great on mobile devices and desktops alike.

Want to try it out? Just clone the repo and open the HTML file in your browser. It’s that easy!
